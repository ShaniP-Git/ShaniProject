#Automation project-'swarovski'

My test project on the 'swarovski' company website.

For the tests, I used the Playwright framework in Python and wrote functions following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
attached video presents the execution of the automated tests. All source code is located in the pro Object structure.
