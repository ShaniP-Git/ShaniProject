#Automation project-'swarovski'

My test project on the 'swarovski' company website.

For the tests, I used the Playwright framework in Python and wrote functions following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The attached video presents the execution of the automated tests.
All source code is located in the project folder and is organized using the Page Object structure.
